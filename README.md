# bl_TTC_weaker_Suppressors
 Weakens Mortys Suppressors.

I really like Morty's weapon mod, but Morty's suppressors are a little too powerful for my liking. Especially on a PVE server.

So I changed the values a bit.

This tiny mod reduces the dampening value from 1.5 to 0.95 (vanilla is 0.89) and reduces the hitpoints from 12 to 8 (vanilla is 4)
So Mortys Suppressors are still better then vanilla but not too strong anymore.

Only M14 Suppressor, the Universal Suppressors and the AKMod Suppressor are affected.
Honeybadger Supp has still the same values... because c'mon it's a Honeybadger.

Feel free to unpack/repack this mod or whatever you like to do, but give credits to Morty.
And please keep in Mind, that this Mod requires Mortys Weapons. Your server won't start without the "Parent".
